# GeneticAlgorithmRandom3SAT
Python implementation of a genetic algorithm for satisfying random 3-CNF sentences in 50 variables. 

Assignment I of Artificial Intelligence (CS F407) coursework at BITS Pilani.

My solution combines heuristics from the [DPLL algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm) with selective mutation. Chosen data representation (explained in the [report](https://github.com/iWrote/GeneticAlgorithmRandom3SAT/blob/main/2018B5A70869G_VARUN.pdf)) maps all operations in the scheme to vectorized instructions on numpy integer arrays.
