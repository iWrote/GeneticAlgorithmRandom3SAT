# GeneticAlgorithmRandom3SAT
Python implementation of a genetic algorithm for satisfying random 3-CNF sentences in 50 variables. Assignment I of Artificial Intelligence (CS F407) coursework at BITS Pilani.
My solution combines heuristics from the [DPLL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm) algorithm with selective mutation. Chosen data representation (explained in report) maps all operations in the scheme to vectorized instructions on numpy integer arrays.
